# Analyzing Used Car Listings on eBay Kleinanzeigen

In this project, I am going to clean the data and analyze the included car listings. The dataset comes from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. It was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points.
